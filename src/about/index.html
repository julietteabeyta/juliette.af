			<h1>about</h1>
			<p>I am a Colorado born and based junior full-stack developer looking to learn and tell bad jokes and I am all out of bad jokes. <br>
			I have a passion for building seamless interactions and creating useful, beautiful digital experiences. In the year that I have been in my current position, I have found that I thrive in an environment which I am challenged and constantly given the opportunity to learn and improve.<br>
			In addition to development, I enjoy good books, good coffee, and miniature versions of every day objects. I am always looking to connect (mostly on twitter or over coffee), so <a href="/contact" style="font-style:italic;">keep in touch!</a></p>
