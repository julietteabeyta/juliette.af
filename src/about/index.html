			<h1>about</h1>
			<p>I am a Colorado born and based junior full-stack developer looking to learn and tell bad jokes and I am all out of bad jokes. <br>
			I have a passion for building seamless interactions and creating useful, beautiful digital experiences. In the year that I have been in my current position, I have found that I thrive in an environment which I am challenged and constantly given the opportunity to learn and improve. ***I will figure out more to write here so that this paragraph is longer and the image is more centered and because I really feel like what I have is insufficient.</p>
